## TODO
* fix the stack size computation (it works for a basic block, but it's unused)
* add the code to correctly compute the flags for the block
* a bit of 'type inference' (mainly to infer the number of arguments
  to a function)
* add the possibily to use `?` and `!` in function names. It's a very
  small addition that helps a lot in understanding the code.
