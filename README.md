# X
A language that compiles to Python's bytecode. I don't have a name,
yet, so, for now, let's just settle for X. The main purpose of this
project is to have a bit of fun with a compiler: don't expect much,
it's just for learning! X won't be the next Clojure.

Much inspiration (and code) is taken from Blip, the Python compiler
written in Haskell.

## Language
Well, not really a language. It's lacking many features, such as
conditionals. Let's focus instead on what it can do:

* arithmetic
* function definition
* function call
* print

What's coming next?
* if
