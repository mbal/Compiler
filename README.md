# Compiler
A language that compiles to Python's bytecode.

## Language
Well, not really a language. Until now, it can only compile an expression like 1+2+3. No IO, no functions, no objects, just sums, for now.
This language (I don't have a name yet, let's call it X) compiles to Python's bytecode.

### Main Features
* It can sum integers. A lot of integers. Just start writing a number, write a plus, write another number, and repeat, until you're tired. Then you can compile, and execute. If nothing happens, don't worry, it's correct! 
* that's pretty much it.
